			<h3>About IGNOU School Management</h3>
			<p>
				IGNOU learners have an open and creative mindset for better critical thinking skills; learning how to build strong supportive relationships, understanding their own impulses, and developing empathy for others. Encouraging them to see the world from a global perspective, our learners are taught to become independent through experiences within and beyond the classroom, whilst technology is embedded in the learning process to enhance creativity. In order to achieve this, The Nexus Way was developed as our guiding philosophy.
